# covid-testing-impact-ma

This repository contains the data and code used for the analyses in "The clinical utility and epidemiological impact of self-testing for SARS-CoV-2 using antigen detecting diagnostics: a systematic review and meta-analysis"

The analyses can be reproduced by running the "analyses.R" file in the "Code" folder. This script reads data from the "Data" folder and generates forest plots in the "Results" folder.

These analyses were originally run on R version 4.1.3 with packages ``meta`` (version 5.2-0), ``readxl`` (version 1.4.0), and ``stringr`` (version 1.4.0).
